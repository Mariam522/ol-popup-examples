# Using ol-popup with bundlers

All examples use the "new" [`ol` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol) and [ol-popup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol-popup).

* [Parcel](./parcel)
* [Webpack](./webpack)
* [Browserify](./browserify) - :warning: only currently OpenLayers v4, see the [Browserify README](./browserify/README.md).

To use the examples, clone the repository then follow the instructions within the README for the bundler you're interested in using.
