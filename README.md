# Using ol-popup with bundlers

All examples use the "new" [`ol` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol) and the [`ol` branch of the ol3-popup](https://github.com/walkermatt/ol3-popup.git#ol).

* [Browserify](./browserify)
* [Parcel](./parcel)
* [Webpack](./webpack)

To use the examples, clone the repository then follow the instructions within the README for the bundler you're interested in using.
